# DNVT
Digital Non-secure Voice Terminal Codeword Testing

This is some crappy support code I wrote for reverse engineering DNVTs. The Arduino code encodes and decodes Differential Manchester, and the Python scripts determine the codewords. There is also a Python script which decodes differential manchester based on a CSV capture from an oscilloscope. Example files are provided.
