Notes:

-The JLCPCB BOM maps all surface mount parts and all through hole parts aside from the DC barrel jack, terminal blocks, and transformers to parts available in JLCPCB's parts library.
-The bottom side parts are optional (additional chassis ground to Pico Ground capacitors and uSD card holder)
-The Digikey BOM lists through hole parts which must be manually assembled as well as the LCSC alternatives for these parts where available.
-The additional BOM lists parts not captured in the Eagle BOM export: headers for the Pico, the case, OLED screen, Front and back plates, screws, nuts, cable for screen, and 48V power supply.
