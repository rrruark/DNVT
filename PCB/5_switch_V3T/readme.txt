Notes:

-The rotation of the inductors and RS422 transceivers must be manually corrected at the placement review step after uploading to JLCPCB.
-The JLCPCB BOM maps all surface mount parts to parts available in JLCPCB's parts library.
-The bottom side parts are optional (additional chassis ground to Pico Ground capacitors and uSD card holder)
-The Digikey BOM lists through hole parts which must be manually assembled as well as the LCSC alternatives for these parts where available.
-The additional BOM lists parts not captured in the Eagle BOM export: headers for the Pico, the case, OLED screen, Front and back plates, screws, nuts, cable for screen, and 48V power supply.
