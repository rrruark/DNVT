\section{General Description}
This PCBA is a Raspberry Pi Pico carrier board which interfaces DNVTs with a Raspberry Pi Pico. This document describes the function of the carrier board subassembly and does not cover custom software which may run on the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller.

DNVTs are powered in common battery (CB) mode through center-tapped isolation transformers from a 48 V DC barrel jack input allowing phones to operate at a distance of up to 4 km from the switch through CAT5e or equivilent wiring. RS422 transceivers translate the 3.3 V logic level signals of the Raspberry Pi Pico to the differential signals required to interface with the DNVTs.

The design files for this switch can be found in the project's \href{https://github.com/PetteriAimonen/latex-datasheet-template/}{Github repository}, and Nick Andre's example firmware can be found in his \href{https://github.com/PetteriAimonen/latex-datasheet-template/}{Github repository}. Details on the design of this board and the process of reverse engineering the DNVT's control codes can be found \href{https://github.com/PetteriAimonen/latex-datasheet-template/}{here}.

This project is entirely open source. Design files for the PCBAs and vill of materials for the case and auxillary components can be found at the above linked repository.

\section{Electrical Specifications}
All specifications are in $0\degree C \leq T_A \leq 70\degree C$. All components are rated to -40 to +85 aside from the line transformers which are rated to $0\degree C$ to $70\degree C$ but which have been tested in qualification to $-20\degree C$ to $+85\degree C$.
